# Visual Review discussions API (deprecated) **(PREMIUM ALL)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/18710) in GitLab 12.5.
> - [Moved](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/01/26/new-gitlab-product-subscription-model/) to GitLab Premium in 13.9.

WARNING:
This feature was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387751) in GitLab 15.8
and is planned for removal in 17.0. This change is a breaking change.

Visual Review discussions are notes on merge requests sent as
feedback from [Visual Reviews](../ci/review_apps/index.md#visual-reviews-deprecated).

## Create new merge request thread

Creates a new thread to a single project merge request. This is similar to creating
a note but other comments (replies) can be added to it later.
